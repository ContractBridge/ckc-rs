Implementation of a modified [Cactus Kev's Poker Hand Evaluator](https://suffe.cool/poker/evaluator.html)
library in Rust. Code inspired and lookup tables borrowed from Vladislav Supalov's 
[pokereval-rs](https://github.com/vsupalov/pokereval-rs)
library, which in turn was inspired by [Cactus Kev's](https://suffe.cool)
[work in C](https://suffe.cool/poker/code/).

The primary entity in the library is a `PokerCard`. `PokerCard` is a u32 
variant of Cactus Kev's binary representation of a poker card. The variation 
being that the `Suit` bits order is inverted for easier sorting by other
libraries:

```txt
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|xxxbbbbb|bbbbbbbb|SHDCrrrr|xxpppppp|
+--------+--------+--------+--------+

p = prime number of rank (deuce=2,trey=3,four=5,...,ace=41)
r = rank of card (deuce=0,trey=1,four=2,five=3,...,ace=12)
SHDC = suit of card (bit turned on based on suit of card)
b = bit turned on depending on rank of card
```

This library contains only the bare bones implementation of the library,
and is [no-std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html) to
maintain maximum utility with [embedded](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/)
and [wasm](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/) Rust.
